# Sherlog 🕵️

Welcome to **Sherlog**, a demo repository created for a talk on **Grafana, Loki, and Promtail** — exploring how to collect, process, and visualize logs in a fun and practical way.

## 🎯 About

This repo contains examples and configurations used in the presentation:

* **Promtail** → collecting and shipping logs
* **Loki** → storing and querying logs
* **Grafana** → building dashboards and making sense of it all

The goal is to make observability approachable, interactive, and maybe even a little fun.

## 📚 Talk Highlights

* What is Grafana and why observability matters
* How logs flow from Promtail → Loki → Grafana
* Writing queries with **LogQL**
* Turning logs into useful metrics
* Building interactive dashboards
* Best practices for log management

## 🚀 Usage

This repo is **not a production setup** — it’s a playground to explore concepts from the talk.
Feel free to fork, clone, or adapt for your own experiments.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Grafana Labs ecosystem for making observability accessible and exciting.
